It\u0026rsquo;s taking me some time to understand how to both use Hugo and get my head around the various theme components, configuration and elements.\nThe way Hugo or any static generators work, is once you have all your templates and layouts setup, creating a new page or update is simply by editing or adding new markdown files that look more like easy to manage plain text files rather than messing around with raw HTML/CSS inline. Once done, you run Hugo to generate which generates all static HTML files, links them together, and then you can simply push all the files to your web server host (more on that later).\nI imagine I\u0026rsquo;ll be customizing it quite a bit, and even adding my own \u0026ldquo;content types\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;archetypes\u0026rdquo; as I go to properly structure the various types of content for HEROBOTS. Hugo seems incredibly flexible, and once properly setup, easy to maintain and edit as I go along researching and compiling information for this site. Hopefully you\u0026rsquo;ll see more improvements to the site soon.\nSo many people might wonder, why don\u0026rsquo;t you just use a standard content management system like Wordpress or even a WYSIWIG site builder? A few reasons why, when you look at a single post or page on this site, it\u0026rsquo;s very straight forward. This makes it super easy to edit, doesn\u0026rsquo;t require a lot of \u0026ldquo;web designing\u0026rdquo; skills, and lets me focus on information. In fact, I\u0026rsquo;m typing this post in a basic text editor that I can do pretty much anywhere.\nSecondly, as I\u0026rsquo;ve seen through my research on the Heathkit HERO or other websites that were very clearly created in the past, a lot of them look super dated or do not render properly in new form factors (like mobile or table). But more importantly, the creators haven\u0026rsquo;t maintained the CMS platforms they were built on whether it be Wordpress or Frontpage or whatever tool it depends on including its database, applications or even programming language it requires to work. At best, this makes those sites hard to maintain over time, and at worst, they can be compromised or simply break over time and taking down all the information within. In fact, some of the best information on HERO were from the old usenet newsgroups, list servers or forums. They were basically emails or plain text, that stood up to the test of time and made it easy to search or grep through to find. See the following example of \u0026ldquo;plain text\u0026rdquo; file that Donnie Savage preserved on his site, it\u0026rsquo;s also an excellent read! Hero Robot Frequently Asked Questions\nAnd finally, if properly done well, this site and the information I compile, should be easy for others to contribute or help maintain. I\u0026rsquo;ll explain more on that later when the site makes more progress. I\u0026rsquo;m still gathering as much information and source material about Heathkit HERO and consolidating it into one place so I can later figure out how to best represent my findings here on this site. Then, hopefully I\u0026rsquo;ll share methods or ways for contributors to help if they want!\nAlso, check out the new logo! It\u0026rsquo;s inspired by the typography found on the side panels of the HERO 1, so you may see some resemblance.\n"});index.add({'id':5,'href':'/posts/ready_2020-06-22/','title':"READY",'content':"This is the first post of the website, and to announce the launch of the website!
