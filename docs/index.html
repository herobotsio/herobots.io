<p>Welcome to the home of the Heathkit HERO robots!</p>
<p>This site is dedicated to the Heathkit Robots and to all the human enthusiasts who still love tinkering, hacking, collecting, or simply reminiscing about these wonderful machines of the past.</p>
<p>The Heathkit HERO robots were a line of robots produced and sold in Heathkit’s venerable catalogs from the early to mid 1980’s by Heath Company. The company released a total of four units; first the HERO 1, then the HERO Jr, and finally followed by the HERO 2000 and the Arm Trainer. The HERO 1 project was led by Jim Lytle who was the Chief Development Engineer at Heath Company. Other notable stakeholders included Douglas Bonham, Jay Jerrit, and Al Prouty at the time.</p>
<p>The HERO stood for “<strong>H</strong>eathkit <strong>E</strong>ducational <strong>RO</strong>bots” and were available even up until 1995, three years after Heathkit exited the electronics kit business in 1992. When Heathkit business started to decline, the HERO line of robots was first transferred to Mobile Ed Productions and then ultimately to Robert Doerr of RobotWorkshop.com. Robert salvaged the remaining inventory of the HERO robots and its documentation rights and continued to support the community of hobbyists and collectors to present day.</p>

<p>The HERO 1 is the most popular and first robot that Heath Co. released in 1982 after work begun in 1979. It was sold as both an educational and professional training tool and came out with optional training courses, books, and even home certification programs. Like many Heathkit electronics kits before its time, you could get a HERO 1 as an unassembled kit (ET-18) that would require you to solder every component and put it together, or a more expensive option as a factory pre-assembled unit (ETW-18).</p>
<p>Along with the HERO 1 robot main unit were many optional boards and features you can add or upgrade the HERO 1. Some of these include a 5 degrees-of-motion arm, speech capability, wired or wireless remote controls, serial interfaces, memory expansion boards, and various preprogrammed ROM modules. Due to its popularity, a handful of third party companies also produced their own memory expansion boards, ROM chips, interface kits, and software.</p>
<p>In addition to the individual hobbyists that could afford the HERO 1, it was most often purchased and used as an educational tool in high schools, technical colleges, and at universities for research in computing and robotics. Purportedly, over 14,000 HERO 1 robots were sold during its lifetime.</p>
<p>The HERO 1 was featured in many technical and science magazines, national and local news coverage, and even TV shows at the time. One of which was Mr. Wizard, a TV program for children that demonstrates the science and technology behind everyday items. The HERO 1 was even demonstrated by Jim Lytle to the United States Congress in a hearing on the role of technology in promoting industrial competitiveness</p>
<p>Numerous research papers, books, and home hobbyist projects were published in academic and industry publications based on the HERO 1. The HERO 1 still appears periodically in projects even today!</p>
